# Build a Recommendation Engine with a Restricted Boltzmann Machine using TensorFlow
Code-pattern to walk through RBM based recommender system using TF

## What is a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)?

## How do Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) help us?

## Our Use Case

## Algorithm Breakdown Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)

## Where else is RBM used?

## How is RBM better to other Algorithms?

## Lets do an exercise

1. Sign up or log in.

    * Activate Watson Studio by logging in to your IBM Cloud account from the [Try IBM Watson](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg) page.
    * Access Watson Studio, by logging in at [https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com?cm_sp=ibmdev-_-developer-tutorials-_-cloudreg).

1. Create an empty project.

    * Click either **Create a project** or **New project**.
    * Select **Create an empty project**.
    * Give the project a name.
    * Choose an existing Object Storage service instance or create a new one.
    * Click **Create**.

1. Add the Notebook.

   * Click **+Add to project**.
   * Click **Notebook**.
   * Click **From URL**.
   * Provide a **Name**.
   * Under **Select runtime**, choose **Default Python 3.6 Free**.
   * Enter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fawazsiddiqi/recommendation-system-with-a-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-using-tensorflow/master/notebooks/CollaborativeFilteringwithRBM.ipynb` as the **Notebook URL**.
   * Click **Create Notebook**.

1. Run the Notebook.

   In the open Notebook, click **Run** to run the cells one at a time. The rest of the tutorial follows the order of the Notebook.
